  Mr. Auchincloss has asked me to prefix a few words of introduction
  to his book:</p>
<p>
  There is little to say, as the book tells its own tale—clear and
  to the point.</p>
<p>
  He has very rightly taken the sidereal year as the basis of his
  calculations; any other system of computation ends only in
  difficulties.</p>
<p>
  But the reader will find other novelties, not the least among
  them being the fact that the prophecies of Daniel are made to
  end with the beginning of the history of the Christian Church,
  instead of lengthening out into a still unknown future; this is
  a great advance on previous interpreters. And he will doubtless
  be struck by calculations according to which the 1290&nbsp;Days of
  the Hebrew Prophet terminated in <span

  Thus far I had written in&nbsp;1902. Since then the public has
  shown that it can appreciate good work by the rapidity with which
  copy after copy of Mr.&nbsp;Auchincloss’ little book has been
  called for. It is now issued once more with additions and
  improvements, but otherwise in an unchanged form.</p>
<p>
  There is one paragraph in it to which the Assyriologist is now
  able to add a few words. Mr.&nbsp;Auchincloss draws attention to
  the sense of completeness and perfection which is associated in the
  Old Testament, not only with the number seven, but also with the
  number ten. It has long been known that the Babylonians possessed
  a week of seven days. But it is only recently that I have pointed
  out that they also possessed a week of five days. Besides the
  week of five days, however, there was a double week of ten days,
  the month consisting of thirty days and being divided into three
  equal parts.</p>

  PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="short w10" />
<p>
  This study of the Book of Daniel is based on the conviction,
  that its word is in very deed the Word of God. In approaching
  the subject we have brought to the solution of its problems only
  such numerals as were known to the ancient Hebrews and to the
  writers of the New Testament. Numerals that were symbolized in
  their feasts and were current before times of rejoicing. But
  towering over all, we have brought God’s own standard of time,
  viz: the sidereal year, which the greatest of modern astronomers
  Laplace and Herschel tell us has not varied the
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> part of
  a second of time in the last 2000 years. We did so under the
  conviction that if the Book of Daniel was of human origin, a
  piece of historic fiction, it could not stand this severe test,
  yet if it was truly the Word of God it would be found resting
  on that bed rock, viz:—a year whose length was</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 9<sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
  seconds</p>
<p class="i0">
  a period unknown to the ancients but given to us by modern
  science. The Book has stood the test and its true character
  comes out in bold relief.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">10</span>

  Without a perfectly fitting key, the tendency of its readers is
  to treat the Book lightly, call in question its statements and
  smile at its prophecies. Time, however, vindicates the statements
  of Daniel and fixes on them the seal of truth. Also, newly-found
  inscriptions both on rocks and tablets, together with ancient
  writings composed in those times, bring to confusion adverse
  criticism.</p>
<p>
  The Book of Daniel is a most important part of the Word of God,
  and is set like a gem among jewels. Its words of warning were
  sounded 600&nbsp;years before the destruction of Jerusalem by
  Titus. Its prophecies are like mile-stones along the highway of
  Jewish history, each one bringing the observer nearer to Messiah’s
  kingdom, to that “Great and Notable day of the Lord”—Pentecost
  of <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;33—when
  the Holy Spirit was manifested to the Jews, also nearer
  to <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;39,
  the year of the manifestation to the Gentiles. Daniel alone
  of all the prophets received Divine illumination regarding these
  dates. They mark the remotest boundary of his book, and therefore
  bar the way to fanciful conclusions in regard to later times.
  Read aright, Daniel’s words have no uncertain sound, they are
  definite and exact like the forecast of an astronomer.</p>

  1. In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah
  came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
  it.</p>
<p class="redcomment">This siege took place in <span
        class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;606.
      Verse&nbsp;5 says that Daniel and the royal captives received
      3&nbsp;years’ training and verse&nbsp;18 shows that at the
      end of 3&nbsp;years they graduated. This brings us to the
      year <span
        class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;603
      which chapter&nbsp;2 verse&nbsp;1 says was the 2nd of
      Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, consequently Nebuchadnezzar began to
      reign in <span
        class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;605.
      This date agrees with the figures given in the Almagesta
      of Ptolemy, also with the statements of Berosus. Besides it
      harmonizes perfectly the Bible account of the first
      5&nbsp;years in Jehoiakim’s reign, as set forth in
      Jeremiah&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">XXV, XXVI, XXVII, XXXV, XXXVI, XLV, XLVI
        </span>,
      and II&nbsp;Kings <span

      Still further a draughtsman can plot it on a chart, with
      the same accuracy that a surveyor can map a piece of land,
      provided he governs his work by that remarkable group of
      locking-dates set forth in Jeremiah&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">XXV.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;3.
      and Ezekiel&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">XL.</span>&nbsp;1.
      also takes full account of the historic events which
      happened in the 1st, 7th, 8th, 18th, and 19th

      <span class="pagenum">18</span>

      years of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. It thus will become manifest
      that Daniel and his companions were taken captive in the
      Summer of <span
        class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;606.</p>
<p>
  2. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
  part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
  the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the
  vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  As foretold in Jeremiah <span
    class="allcap">XXIX.</span>&nbsp;10.
  the captivity of Judah lasted 70&nbsp;years, <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;606 to <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;536,
  when the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to proclaim
  freedom to the captives. Ezra 1st. chap. Isaiah&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XLIV.</span>&nbsp;28.</p>
<p>
  3. And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
  that he should bring <em>certain</em> of the children of Israel,
  and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;</p>
<p>
  4. Children in whom <em>was</em> no blemish, but well favoured,
  and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
  understanding science, and such as <em>had</em> ability in
  them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach
  the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Precisely as foretold by the prophet Isaiah,
      more than a century prior to the event. Isaiah&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">XXXIX.</span>&nbsp;7.</p>
<p>
  5. And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s
  meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
  years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
  king.</p>
<p>
  6. Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
  Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">19</span>

  7. Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
  unto Daniel <em>the name</em> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah,
  of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
  Abed-nego.</p>
<p>
  8. But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
  himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine
  which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
  eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</p>
<p class="redcomment">“Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job
    were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their
    righteousness.” Ezekiel&nbsp;<span
      class="allcap">XIV.</span>&nbsp;14.
    Note in passing, that by order of birth these names should
    be read Noah, Job and Daniel. However, according to a custom
    common among the writers of Scripture, the line of Divine
    favor was followed in preference to the order of birth. For
    example, Japheth, Ham, Shem was the order of birth; but the
    records stands: “These are the generations of the sons of Noah;
    Shem, Ham and Japheth.” So too we read of “Abram, Nahor, and
    Haran” when the order of birth was Haran, Nahor and Abram. Also
    of “Aaron and Moses and Miriam,” when the true order was Miriam,
    Aaron and Moses.</p>
<p>
  9. Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
  the prince of the eunuchs.</p>
<p>
  10. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my
  lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink:
  for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children
  which <em>are</em> of

  <span class="pagenum">20</span>

  your sort? then shall ye make <em>me</em> endanger my head to the
  king.</p>
<p>
  11. Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs
  had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>
<p>
  12. Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
  give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  The Scriptures everywhere associate a sense of completeness and
  perfection with the numeral&nbsp;7, also with the numeral&nbsp;10.
  The Mosaic Law teems with instances of this sort. A Sabbatic period
  covered 7&nbsp;years. Sprinklings were administered 7&nbsp;times,
  feasts lasted 7&nbsp;days, priests carried 7&nbsp;trumpets,
  Jericho was compassed 7&nbsp;times, Naaman bathed 7&nbsp;times
  in the Jordan, a servant bowed 7&nbsp;times to his lord and so
  on. As to the numeral&nbsp;10, the Law had 10&nbsp;commandments,
  the tabernacle had 10&nbsp;curtains, 10&nbsp;pillars,
  10&nbsp;sockets. After the Israelites had tempted the Lord
  10&nbsp;times, they were condemned to die in the wilderness.
  Ten plagues were inflicted on the Egyptians. In the matter of
  taxation, the herd was divided into 10&nbsp;parts and one part set
  aside for the Lord.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  When Nebuchadnezzar tested Daniel and his companions, “he
  found them 10&nbsp;times better than all the magicians and
  astrologers.” Thus we see plainly that the numerals&nbsp;7
  and&nbsp;10 conveyed the idea of completeness and perfection
  to the Hebrew mind.</p>

  <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;603.</div>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">21</span>

  13. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
  countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s
  meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>
<p>
  14. So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
  days.</p>
<p>
  15. And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer
  and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the
  portion of the king’s meat.</p>
<p>
  16. Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
  that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>
<p>
  17. As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
  in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all
  visions and dreams.</p>
<p class="redcomment">“Behold art thou wiser than Daniel.”
      Ezekiel&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">XXVIII.</span>&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>
  18. Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
  bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
  before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="redcomment">At the end of the 3&nbsp;years spoken of in
      verse&nbsp;5.</p>
<p>
  19. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
  none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood
  they before the king.</p>
<p>
  20. And in all matters of wisdom <em>and</em> understanding, that
  the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than
  all the magicians <em>and</em> astrologers that <em>were</em>
  in all his realm.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">22</span>

  21. And Daniel continued <em>even</em> unto the first year of
  king Cyrus.</p>

<p class="redcomment">
  Cyrus began to reign, as king of Persia in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;558,
  just twenty years prior to his conquest of Babylon in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;538.
  The verse of course refers to the first year of his reign as king
  of Babylon. In the following chapter the narrative goes back to
  <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;603
  which as already explained was the 2nd year of Nebuchadnezzar’s
  individual reign. His father Nabopolassar was still on the throne
  in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;606,
  but on his death in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;605
  Nebuchadnezzar returned at once to Babylon and was made king,
  with full authority.</p>

  CHAPTER II. [<span
    class="smcap">Hebrew and Syriac.</span>]</h3>
<div class="i0 figleft">
  <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;603.</div>
<p>
  1. And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,
  Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was
  troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p>
<p>
  2. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
  astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show
  the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</p>
<p>
  3. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
  spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  From this point to the end of the <span
    class="smcap sm">VI</span>&nbsp;chapter
  Daniel wrote in the Syriac language. The rest of the book
  was written in Hebrew. In our own day men of affairs converse
  and write in several languages. Evidently one who was fitted
  to preside over 120&nbsp;princes had many languages at his
  command.</p>
<p>
  4. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O&nbsp;king,
  live for ever; tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the
  interpretation.</p>
<p>
  5. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
  from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
  interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your
  houses shall be made a dunghill.</p>
<p>
  6. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
  shall receive of me gifts and rewards and

  <span class="pagenum">24</span>

  great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation
  thereof.</p>
<p>
  7. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
  the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
<p>
  8. The king answered and said, I&nbsp;know of certainty that ye
  would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
<p>
  9. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <em>there
  is but</em> one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and
  corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed:
  therefore tell me the dream, and I&nbsp;shall know that ye can shew
  me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>
  10. The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There
  is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter:
  therefore <em>there is</em> no king, lord, nor ruler,
  <em>that</em> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer,
  or Chaldean.</p>
<p>
  11. And <em>it is</em> a rare thing that the king requireth, and
  there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the
  gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p>
  12. For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and
  commanded to destroy all the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon.</p>
<p>
  13. And the decree went forth that the wise <em>men</em> should
  be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p>
  14. Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
  captain of the king’s guard,

  <span class="pagenum">25</span>

  which was gone forth to slay the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon:</p>
<p>
  15. He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why
  <em>is</em> the decree <em>so</em> hasty from the king? Then
  Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>
<p>
  16. Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he
  would give him time, and that he would shew the king the
  interpretation.</p>
<p>
  17. Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
  Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>
<p>
  18. That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven
  concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should
  not perish with the rest of the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon.</p>
<p>
  19. Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
  Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
<p>
  20. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
  and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>
<p>
  21. And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
  and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and
  knowledge to them that know understanding:</p>
<p>
  22. He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what
  <em>is</em> in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p>
<p>
  23. I thank thee, and praise thee, O&nbsp;thou God of my fathers,
  who hast given me wisdom and might

  <span class="pagenum">26</span>

  and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou
  hast <em>now</em> made known unto us the king’s matter.</p>
<p>
  24. Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had
  ordained to destroy the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon: he went
  and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise <em>men</em> of
  Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the
  king the interpretation.</p>
<p>
  25. Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
  said thus unto him, I&nbsp;have found a man of the captives of
  Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p>
  26. The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <em>was</em>
  Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which
  I&nbsp;have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
<p>
  27. Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
  secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise <em>men</em>,
  the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the
  king;</p>
<p>
  28. But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
  maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
  latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy
  bed, are these:</p>
<p>
  29. As for thee, O&nbsp;king, thy thoughts came <em>into thy
  mind</em> upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he
  that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to
  pass.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">27</span>

  30. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for
  <em>any</em> wisdom that I&nbsp;have more than any living, but for
  <em>their</em> sakes that shall make known the interpretation
  to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy
  heart.</p>
<p>
  31. Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
  image, whose brightness <em>was</em> excellent, stood before
  thee; and the form thereof <em>was</em> terrible.</p>
<p>
  32. This image’s head <em>was</em> of fine gold, his breast and
  his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</p>
<p>
  33. His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
<p>
  34. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands,
  which smote the image upon his feet <em>that were</em> of iron
  and clay, and brake them to pieces.</p>
<p>
  35. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
  gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the
  summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no
  place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image
  became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p>
  36. This <em>is</em> the dream; and we will tell the
  interpretation thereof before the king.</p>
<p>
  37. Thou, O king, <em>art</em> a king of kings: for the God
  of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and
  glory.</p>
<p>
  38. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
  field and the fowls of the heaven

  <span class="pagenum">28</span>

  hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them
  all. Thou <em>art</em> this head of gold.</p>
<p>
  39. And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to
  thee</p>
<p class="redcomment">the Medo-Persian</p>
<p>and
  another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all
  the earth</p>
<p class="redcomment">the Macedonian.</p>
<p>
  40. And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron:</p>
<p class="redcomment">the Roman Empire</p>
<p>forasmuch
  as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
  that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
<p>
  41. And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’
  clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there
  shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou
  sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p>
<p>
  42. And <em>as</em> the toes of the feet <em>were</em> part of
  iron, and part of clay, <em>so</em> the kingdom shall be partly
  strong, and partly broken.</p>
<p>
  43. And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
  mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave
  one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p>
<p>
  44. And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
  a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall
  not be left to other people, <em>but</em> it shall break in
  pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
  ever.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  The birth of Christ took place in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;2,
  in the palmiest days of the Roman Empire. The angel

  <span class="pagenum">29</span>

  Gabriel declared, thou “shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be
  great and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord
  God shall give unto him the throne of his father David; and he
  shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom
  there shall be no end.”—Luke&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;31.—The
  right of taxation is the prerogative of sovereign power. When
  therefore Augustus Caesar began to enroll the Jews for purposes
  of taxation in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;2
  the power of the holy people was at an end and the full time
  of prophecy had arrived. It was then that Christ was born in
  Bethlehem of Judea. “The Sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
  nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and
  unto him shall the gathering of the people be.”—Genesis&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XLIX.</span>&nbsp;10.</p>
<p>
  45. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
  mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
  the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
  hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter:
  and the dream <em>is</em> certain, and the interpretation
  thereof sure.</p>
<p>
  46. Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and
  worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an
  oblation and sweet odours unto him.</p>
<p>
  47. The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth <em>it
  is</em>, that your God <em>is</em> a God of gods, and a Lord of
  kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal
  this secret.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">30</span>

  48. Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many
  great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province
  of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise
  <em>men</em> of Babylon.</p>
<p>
  49. Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach,
  Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of
  Babylon: but Daniel <em>sat</em> in the gate of the king.</p>

  1. Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
  <em>was</em> threescore cubits, <em>and</em> the breadth thereof
  six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province
  of Babylon.</p>
<p class="redcomment">The dream described in the previous chapter, seems
      to have touched the inventive genius of king Nebuchadnezzar
      in a way, that inspired him to produce a mechanically perfect
      image—a casting of gold of priceless value—especially strong
      in every part, and one in which there were no planes of
      weakness whatever. An image that seemed to bid defiance
      to the course of events foreshadowed by the prophet
      Daniel.</p>
<p>
  2. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the
  princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the
  treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
  of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
  Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Doubtless it was in response to this invitation

  flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds

  Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.</p>
<p class="redcomment">A monarch so wealthy and whose sway covered so
      many lands, must have had at his command musicians, highly

<p>
  6. And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour

<p class="redcomment">
  At the time of the Babylonian captivity the Hebrews began to be
  known as Jews, or inhabitants of Judea.</p>
<p>
  9. They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O&nbsp;king,
  live for ever.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">33</span>

  10. Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
  hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
  and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and
  worship the golden image:</p>
<p>
  11. And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, <em>that</em>
  he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p>
  12. There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of
  the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these
  men, O&nbsp;king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods,
  nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
<p>
  13. Then Nebuchadnezzar in <em>his</em> rage and fury commanded
  to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought
  these men before the king.</p>
<p>
  14. Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, <em>Is it</em> true,
  O&nbsp;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods,
  nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>
<p>
  15. Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of
  the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and
  all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which
  I&nbsp;have made; <em>well</em>: but if ye worship not, ye shall be
  cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace;
  and who <em>is</em> that God that shall deliver you out of my
  hands?</p>
<p>
  16. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered

  <span class="pagenum">34</span>

  and said to the king, O&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar, we <em>are</em> not
  careful to answer thee in this matter.</p>
<p>
  17. If it be <em>so</em>, our God whom we serve is able to
  deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver
  <em>us</em> out of thine hand, O&nbsp;king.</p>
<p>
  18. But if not, be it known unto thee, O&nbsp;king, that we will
  not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
  set up.</p>
<p>
  19. Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
  visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego:
  <em>therefore</em> he spake, and commanded that they should
  heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be
  heated.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Or, 8&nbsp;times as hot as the usual temperature.
      The numeral&nbsp;7 expressed the utmost intensity known to the
      king.</p>
<p>
  20. And he commanded the most mighty men that <em>were</em> in
  his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, <em>and</em>
  to cast <em>them</em> into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p>
  21. Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
  their hats, and their <em>other</em> garments, and were cast
  into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p>
  22. Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the
  furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that
  took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</p>
<p class="redcomment">This seems to have been what is technically
      called “back-draught,” which those who are skilled in
      feeding furnaces

      <span class="pagenum">35</span>

      are careful to guard against, but which a soldier knows
      nothing about.</p>
<p>
  23. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell
  down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p>
  24. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
  haste, <em>and</em> spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did
  not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They
  answered and said unto the king, True, O&nbsp;king.</p>
<p>
  25. He answered and said, Lo, I&nbsp;see four men loose, walking in
  the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
  fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
<p>
  26. Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
  fiery furnace, <em>and</em> spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach,
  and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth,
  and come <em>hither</em>. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
  came forth of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p>
  27. And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s
  counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose
  bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head
  singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of
  fire had passed on them.</p>
<p>
  28. <em>Then</em> Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed
  <em>be</em> the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who
  hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted
  in him, and have changed the king’s

  <span class="pagenum">36</span>

  word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor
  worship any god, except their own God.</p>
<p>
  29. Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation,
  and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God
  of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces,
  and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is
  no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p>
<p>
  30. Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
  in the province of Babylon.</p>

  CHAPTER IV. [<span
    class="smcap">Syriac.</span>]</h3>
<p>
  1. Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and
  languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
  unto you.</p>
<p>
  2. I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high
  God hath wrought toward me.</p>
<p>
  3. How great <em>are</em> his signs! and how mighty <em>are</em>
  his wonders! his kingdom <em>is</em> an everlasting kingdom, and
  his dominion <em>is</em> from generation to generation.</p>
<p>
  4. I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in
  my palace:</p>
<p>
  5. I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
  bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p>
  6. Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise
  <em>men</em> of Babylon before me, that they might make
  known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</p>
<p>
  7. Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
  and the soothsayers: and I&nbsp;told the dream before them; but
  they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>
  8. But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
  Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom
  <em>is</em> the spirit of the holy gods: and before him
  I&nbsp;told the dream, <em>saying</em>,</p>
<p>
  9. O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I&nbsp;know
  that the spirit of the holy gods <em>is</em> in

  <span class="pagenum">38</span>

  thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my
  dream that I&nbsp;have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>
  10. Thus <em>were</em> the visions of mine head in my bed;
  I&nbsp;saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the
  height thereof <em>was</em> great.</p>
<p>
  11. The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof
  reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all
  the earth:</p>
<p>
  12. The leaves thereof <em>were</em> fair, and the fruit thereof
  much, and in it <em>was</em> meat for all: the beasts of the
  field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt
  in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</p>
<p>
  13. I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold,
  a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</p>
<p>
  14. He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut
  off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit:
  let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his
  branches:</p>
<p>
  15. Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even
  with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
  and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <em>let</em> his
  portion <em>be</em> with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</p>
<p>
  16. Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart
  be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  In view of the fact that Nebuchadnezzar’s probation

  <span class="pagenum">39</span>

  lasted for 12&nbsp;months, see verse&nbsp;29, it is reasonable
  to suppose that his dementia lasted for 7&nbsp;months, or until
  the moon had passed over him 7&nbsp;times, a period long enough
  to permit a rank growth of both hair and nails and yet short
  enough for a regency to hold his kingdom together without losing
  hope of his final recovery. Besides the events in the years of
  his reign are too well known to admit of a much longer season
  of affliction.</p>
<p>
  17. This matter <em>is</em> by the decree of the watchers, and
  the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the
  living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
  and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the
  basest of men.</p>
<p>
  18. This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou,
  O&nbsp;Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch
  as all the wise <em>men</em> of my kingdom are not able to make
  known unto me the interpretation: but thou <em>art</em> able;
  for the spirit of the holy gods <em>is</em> in thee.</p>
<p>
  19. Then Daniel, whose name <em>was</em> Belteshazzar, was
  astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The
  king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the
  interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered
  and said, My lord, the dream <em>be</em> to them that hate
  thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</p>
<p>
  20. The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
  height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the
  earth;</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">40</span>

  21. Whose leaves <em>were</em> fair, and the fruit thereof much,
  and in it <em>was</em> meat for all; under which the beasts of
  the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven
  had their habitation:</p>
<p>
  22. It <em>is</em> thou, O king, that art grown and become
  strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven,
  and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</p>
<p>
  23. And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming
  down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
  yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with
  a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
  and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <em>let</em> his
  portion <em>be</em> with the beasts of the field, till seven
  times pass over him;</p>
<p>
  24. This <em>is</em> the interpretation, O&nbsp;king, and this
  <em>is</em> the decree of the most High, which is come upon
  my lord the king:</p>
<p>
  25. That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall
  be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to
  eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of
  heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know
  that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it
  to whomsoever he will.</p>
<p>
  26. And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
  roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou
  shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">41</span>

  27. Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee,
  and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
  shewing mercies to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy
  tranquillity.</p>
<p>
  28. All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p>
  29. At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
  kingdom of Babylon.</p>
<p>
  30. The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that
  I&nbsp;have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my
  power, and for the honour of my majesty?</p>
<p>
  31. While the word <em>was</em> in the king’s mouth, there fell
  a voice from heaven, <em>saying</em>, O&nbsp;king Nebuchadnezzar,
  to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</p>
<p>
  32. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling
  <em>shall be</em> with the beasts of the field: they shall
  make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass
  over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the
  kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
<p>
  33. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar:
  and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
  body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
  like eagles’ <em>feathers</em>, and his nails like birds’
  <em>claws</em>.</p>
<p>
  34. And at the end of the days I&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
  eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me and
  I&nbsp;blessed the most High, and I&nbsp;praised and honoured him
  that liveth

  <span class="pagenum">42</span>

  for ever, whose dominion <em>is</em> an everlasting dominion, and
  his kingdom <em>is</em> from generation to generation:</p>
<p>
  35. And all the inhabitants of the earth <em>are</em> reputed
  as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of
  heaven, and <em>among</em> the inhabitants of the earth: and
  none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p>
  36. At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the
  glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto
  me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I&nbsp;was
  established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added
  unto me.</p>
<p>
  37. Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King
  of heaven, all whose works <em>are</em> truth, and his ways
  judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p>

  CHAPTER V. [<span

<div class="i0 figleft">
  <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;538.</div>
<p>
  1. Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
  lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</p>
<p class="redcomment">According to the Almagesta of Ptolemy, Nabonadios
      the father of Belshazzar ruled Babylon for 17&nbsp;years.
      During the last 3&nbsp;years of his reign the court and the
      army were under the control of his son who became acting
      king. The three tablets of Belshazzar fully establish his
      identity and the annalistic tablet of Cyrus throws much
      light on the affairs of the Chaldean court during the last
      years of the joint-reign. It reads like a nice piece of
      detective work.</p>
<p>
  2. Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
  golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had
  taken out of the temple which <em>was</em> in Jerusalem; that
  the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might
  drink therein.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Belshazzar’s mother was a daughter of
      Nebuchadnezzar and the word Father is used in the sense
      of grandfather, exactly as in <span
        class="allcap">II</span>&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;19.&nbsp;24.
      Mephibosheth is spoken of as the son of Saul, when in fact he
      was the grandson of Saul.</p>
<p>
  3. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
  the temple of the house of God which <em>was</em> at Jerusalem;
  and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines,
  drank in them.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">44</span>

  4. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
  of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p>
<p>
  5. In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and
  wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the
  wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the
  hand that wrote.</p>
<p>
  6. Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts
  troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
  his knees smote one against another.</p>
<p>
  7. The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
  Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. <em>And</em> the king spake,
  and said to the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon, Whosoever shall
  read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof,
  shall be clothed with purple,</p>
<p class="redcomment sm">R.V.</p>
<p>and
  <em>have</em> a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the
  third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p class="redcomment">First Nabonadios, second Belshazzar, his son, and
      third the Interpreter.</p>
<p>
  8. Then came in all the king’s wise <em>men</em>: but they
  could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the
  interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>
  9. Then was the king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his
  countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p>
<p>
  10. <em>Now</em> the queen by reason of the words of the king
  and his lords came into the banquet house: <em>and</em> the
  queen spake and said, O&nbsp;king, live for ever: let not thy
  thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.</p>
<p class="redcomment">This queen was the wife of Nabonadios

      <span class="pagenum">45</span>

      and mother of Belshazzar. Her death is recorded on the
      annalistic tablet of Cyrus. Her funeral rites were
      conducted by Cambyses in the “Temple of the Sceptre
      of the world,” and his free will offerings aggregated
      “Ten times the usual amount,” a most appropriate tribute
      to the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, that wonderful warrior,
      engineer and man of letters.</p>
<p>
  11. There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom <em>is</em> the
  spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light
  and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was
  found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the
  king, <em>I&nbsp;say</em>, thy father, made master of the
  magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, <em>and</em> soothsayers;</p>
<p>
  12. Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
  understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard
  sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
  Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be
  called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p>
  13. Then was Daniel brought in before the king. <em>And</em>
  the king spake and said unto Daniel, <em>Art</em> thou that
  Daniel, which <em>art</em> of the children of the captivity
  of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</p>
<p>
  14. I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods
  <em>is</em> in thee, and <em>that</em> light and understanding
  and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</p>
<p>
  15. And now the wise <em>men</em>, the astrologers, have

  <span class="pagenum">46</span>

  been brought in before me, that they should read this writing,
  and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they
  could not shew the interpretation of the thing:</p>
<p>
  16. And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
  interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read
  the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof,
  thou shalt be clothed with purple,</p>
<p class="redcomment sm">R.V.</p>
<p>and
  <em>have</em> a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the
  third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p>
  17. Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
  be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I&nbsp;will
  read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the
  interpretation.</p>
<p>
  18. O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
  a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p>
<p>
  19. And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations,
  and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he
  slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set
  up; and whom he would he put down.</p>
<p>
  20. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
  pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his
  glory from him:</p>
<p>
  21. And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was
  made like the beasts, and his dwelling <em>was</em> with the
  wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was
  wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God
  ruled in the

  <span class="pagenum">47</span>

  kingdom of men, and <em>that</em> he appointeth over it
  whomsoever he will.</p>
<p>
  22. And thou his son, O&nbsp;Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine
  heart, though thou knewest all this;</p>
<p>
  23. But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
  they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou,
  and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine
  in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of
  brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know:
  and the God in whose hand thy breath <em>is</em>, and whose
  <em>are</em> all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</p>
<p>
  24. Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
  was written.</p>
<p>
  25. And this <em>is</em> the writing that was written, MENE,
  MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</p>
<p>
  26. This <em>is</em> the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God
  hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.</p>
<p>
  27. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
  wanting.</p>
<p>
  28. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
  Persians.</p>
<p>
  29. Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with
  purple,</p>
<p class="redcomment sm">R.V.</p>
<p>and
  <em>put</em> a chain of gold about his neck, and made a
  proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third
  ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p>
  30. In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans
  slain.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">48</span>

  31. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, <em>being</em> about
  threescore and two years old.</p>
<p class="redcomment">After Cyrus entered Babylon and pacified its
      inhabitants he started on other expeditions and temporarily
      placed on the throne his uncle Cyaxares, king of the Medes,
      who was known as Darius among his new subjects, a name less
      liable to be confused with that of his illustrious nephew.
      It is a well known fact, that expediency often determines
      the choice of an official name for the sovereign. Thus
      the present king of England might have been known as
      Albert&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">I</span>,
      instead of Edward&nbsp;<span class="allcap">VII</span>.

<p>
  1. It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and
  twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</p>
<p>
  2. And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel <em>was</em>
  first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the
  king should have no damage.</p>
<p>
  3. Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and
  princes, because an excellent spirit <em>was</em> in him; and
  the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</p>

<p>
  4. Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
  against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find
  none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he <em>was</em> faithful,
  neither was there any error or fault found in him.</p>
<p>
  5. Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
  this Daniel, except we find <em>it</em> against him concerning
  the law of his God.</p>
<p>
  6. Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
  king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</p>
<p>
  7. All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
  princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted
  together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree,
  that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty
  days, save

  <span class="pagenum">50</span>

  of thee, O&nbsp;king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</p>
<p>
  8. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing,
  that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
  Persians, which altereth not.</p>
<p>
  9. Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</p>
<p>
  10. Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went
  into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
  Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
  prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</p>
<p>
  11. Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
  supplication before his God.</p>
<p>
  12. Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
  king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that
  shall ask <em>a petition</em> of any God or man within thirty
  days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?
  The king answered and said, The thing <em>is</em> true, according
  to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>
<p>
  13. Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
  which <em>is</em> of the children of the captivity of Judah,
  regardeth not thee, O&nbsp;king, nor the decree that thou hast
  signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</p>
<p>
  14. Then the king, when he heard <em>these</em> words, was sore
  displeased with himself, and set <em>his</em> heart on

  <span class="pagenum">51</span>

  Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the
  sun to deliver him.</p>
<p>
  15. Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
  king, Know, O&nbsp;king, that the law of the Medes and Persians
  <em>is</em>, That no decree nor statute which the king
  establisheth may be changed.</p>
<p>
  16. Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast
  <em>him</em> into the den of lions. <em>Now</em> the king spake
  and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he
  will deliver thee.</p>
<p>
  17. And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
  and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet
  of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning
  Daniel.</p>
<p>
  18. Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
  neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his
  sleep went from him.</p>
<p>
  19. Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
  haste unto the den of lions.</p>
<p>
  20. And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
  unto <span
    title="TN: originally spelled ‘Danel’"
    class="msg">Daniel</span>:
  <em>and</em> the king spake and said to Daniel, O&nbsp;Daniel,
  servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
  continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</p>
<p>
  21. Then said Daniel unto the king, O&nbsp;king, live for ever.</p>
<p>
  22. My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths,
  that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency
  was found in me; and also before thee, O&nbsp;king, have I done no
  hurt.</p>
<p>
  23. Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that
  they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up
  out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because
  he believed in his God.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Hebrews&nbsp;<span
      class="allcap">XI.</span>&nbsp;32,&nbsp;33.</p>
<p>
  24. And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
  accused Daniel, and they cast <em>them</em> <span
    title="TN: originally spelled ‘ino’"
    class="msg">into</span>
  the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and
  the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in
  pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p>
<p>
  25. Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and
  languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
  unto you.</p>
<p>
  26. I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
  tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he <em>is</em>
  the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom
  <em>that</em> which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion
  <em>shall be even</em> unto the end.</p>
<p>
  27. He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
  in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power
  of the lions.</p>
<p>
  28. So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
  reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>

  CHAPTER VII. [<span

<div class="i0 figleft">
  <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;541.</div>
<p>
  1. In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
  dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
  dream, <em>and</em> told the sum of the matters.</p>
<p>
  2. Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
  behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great
  sea.</p>
<p class="redcomment">The known world.</p>
<p>
  3. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
  another.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Symbolical of Four powerful
  dynasties.</p>
<div class="i0 figleft">
  <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;490.</div>
<p>
  4. The first <em>was</em> like a lion, and had eagle’s wings:</p>
<p class="redcomment">Medo-Persian empire.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;beheld
  till the wings thereof were plucked,</p>
<p class="redcomment">Persia defeated by Greece at Marathon.</p>
<p>and
  it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as
  a man, and a man’s heart was given unto it.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Was transformed by Greek art and
      civilization.</p>
<p>
  5. And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear,</p>
<p class="redcomment">The Hellenes, or Greece and her colonies in their
      palmy days</p>
<p>and
  it raised up itself on one side,</p>
<p class="redcomment">faced in the direction of Persia</p>
<p>and

  <span class="pagenum">54</span>

  <em>it had</em> three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth
  of it:</p>
<p class="redcomment">3&nbsp;columns of strength, viz:—Athens, Sparta
      and Thebes. The vision made its appearance 21&nbsp;years
      before the Alliance was formed. The ribs therefore, had not
      knit in place when the heavenly visitor made known the fact
      of their future union. The alliance lasted 93&nbsp;years,
      see Thucydides&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">III.</span>&nbsp;69.</p>
<p>and
  they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh</p>
<p class="redcomment">destroy hundreds of thousands in your Persian and
      civil wars.</p>
<p>
  6. After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard,</p>
<p class="redcomment">The Macedonian Empire</p>
<p>which
  had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
  four heads; and dominion was given to it.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  Philip king of Macedon subjugated the disunited Greek States at
  the battle of Chaeronea in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;338,
  and Alexander the Great conquered a kingdom extending from Greece
  to India in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;336.</p>
<p>
  7. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
  beast, dreadful and terrible,</p>
<p class="redcomment">Roman Empire.</p>
<p>and
  strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and
  brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and
  it <em>was</em> diverse</p>
<p class="redcomment">a republic, not a kingdom</p>
<p>from
  all the beasts that <em>were</em> before it; and it had
  10&nbsp;horns.</p>
<p class="redcomment">verse&nbsp;24, the rulers following the Jugurthine
      war.</p>
<p>
  8. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
  another little horn,</p>
<p class="redcomment">the family of the Caesars</p>
<p>before
  whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots:
  and,

  <span class="pagenum">55</span>

  behold, in this horn <em>were</em> eyes like the eyes of a man,
  and a mouth speaking great things</p>
<p class="redcomment">the triumvirate ended with the battle of Actium
      Sept.&nbsp;3rd, <span
        class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;31.
      Divine honors were accorded to Augustus. He took
      3&nbsp;censuses of the Roman Empire and possessed the
      most intimate knowledge of its resources, the last inventory
      was found in his own handwriting. Suetonius, Aug.&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">XVI.</span>——Livy&nbsp;<span
          class="allcap">CXXXII.</span></p>
<p>
  9. I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
  days did sit, whose garment <em>was</em> white as snow, and the
  hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne <em>was like</em>
  the fiery flame, <em>and</em> his wheels <em>as</em> burning
  fire.</p>
<p>
  10. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him:
  thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times
  ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the
  books were opened.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Divine forbearance had reached its limit, the
      voice of the prophets went unheeded, and the desolation
      spoken of by Moses was about to fall on the Jews.</p>
<p>
  11. I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which
  the horn spake: I beheld <em>even</em> till the beast was slain,
  and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</p>
<p>
  12. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their
  dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a
  season and time.</p>
<p>
  13. I saw in the night visions, and, behold, <em>one</em> like
  the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,</p>
<p class="redcomment">“while

      <span class="pagenum">56</span>

      they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out
      of their sight,” Acts&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;9</p>
<p>and
  came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before
  him.</p>
<p class="redcomment">“I&nbsp;see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
      standing on the right hand of God.”—Acts&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">VII.</span>&nbsp;55.</p>
<p>
  14. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
  that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his
  dominion <em>is</em> an everlasting dominion, which shall not
  pass away, and his kingdom <em>that</em> which shall not be
  destroyed.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  “For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the
  government shall be upon his shoulders: and his name shall be
  called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
  Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government
  and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and
  upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment
  and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the
  Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isa.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">IX.</span>&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;7.</p>
<p>
  15. I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of <em>my</em>
  body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p>
  16. I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him
  the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
  interpretation of the things.</p>
<p>
  17. These great beasts, which are four, <em>are</em> four kings,
  <em>which</em> shall arise out of the earth.</p>
<p>
  18. But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
  possess the kingdom for ever, even

  <span class="pagenum">57</span>

  for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="redcomment">The Spiritual kingdom of the Messiah.</p>
<p>
  19. Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
  diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
  <em>were</em> of iron, and his nails <em>of</em> brass;
  <em>which</em> devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the
  residue with his feet;</p>
<p>
  20. And of the ten horns that <em>were</em> in his head, and
  <em>of</em> the other which came up, and before whom three fell;
  even <em>of</em> that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake
  very great things, whose look <em>was</em> more stout than his
  fellows.</p>
<p>
  21. I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
  prevailed against them;</p>
<p class="redcomment">Nero the descendant of Augustus began the first
      persecution in <span
        class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;65.</p>
<p>
  22. Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to
  the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
  possessed the kingdom.</p>
<p>
  23. Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
  upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall
  devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it
  in pieces.</p>
<p>
  24. And the ten horns out of this kingdom <em>are</em> ten kings
  <em>that</em> shall arise: and another shall rise after them;
  and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue
  three kings.</p>
<p>
  25. And he</p>
<p class="redcomment">in the person of his descendants</p>
<p>shall
  speak <em>great</em> words against the most High, and shall wear
  out the saints of the most High, and

  <span class="pagenum">58</span>

  think to change times and laws: and they shall be given unto his
  hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
<p class="redcomment">This formula summarizes that which has gone
      before. It starts with the Medo-Persian kingdom of Cyrus,
      established in the year <span
        class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;558,
      as typified by the lion in verse four, and reaches over to
      the year <span
        class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;39
      when the Gentiles were admitted to Messiah’s kingdom as
      promised in verse&nbsp;18. For full explanation see <span
        class="smcap">Note</span>&nbsp;B.</p>
<p>
  26. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
  dominion, to consume and to destroy <em>it</em> unto the end.</p>
<p>
  27. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the
  kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people
  of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom <em>is</em> an
  everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey
  him.</p>
<p>
  28. Hitherto <em>is</em> the end of the matter. As for me Daniel,
  my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in
  me: but I&nbsp;kept the matter in my heart.</p>

<div class="i0 figleft">
  <span

<p>
  1. In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
  appeared unto me, <em>even unto</em> me Daniel, after that
  which appeared unto me at the first.</p>
<p>
  2. And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I&nbsp;saw,
  that I&nbsp;<em>was</em> at Shushan <em>in</em> the palace, which
  <em>is</em> in the province of Elam; and I&nbsp;saw in a vision,
  and I&nbsp;was by the river of Ulai.</p>
<p>
  3. Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
  before the river a ram which had <em>two</em> horns: and the
  <em>two</em> horns <em>were</em> high;</p>
<p class="redcomment">the Medo-Persian Empire</p>
<p>but
  one</p>
<p class="redcomment">Persia</p>
<p><em>was</em>
  higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
<p>
  4. I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and
  southward;</p>
<p class="redcomment">The Medo-Persian Empire embraced all the civilized
      nations of Asia</p>
<p>so
  that no beast might stand before him, neither was there any that

<p class="redcomment">Cyrus, and his descendants and next of
      kin</p>
<p>did
  according to his will, and became great.</p>
<p>
  5. And as I was considering, behold a he-goat</p>
<p class="redcomment">The Hellenes (Greece and her colonies)</p>
<p>came
  from the West on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the
  ground; and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">60</span>

  6. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I&nbsp;had seen
  standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his
  power</p>

<p>and
  he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and

<p class="redcomment">Alexander was greatly pleased when shown this
      prophecy—Josephus&nbsp;11.&nbsp;8.&nbsp;5.</p>
<p>but

<p class="redcomment"><span

      Alexander defeated the Persians on the plain of Babylon. He
      then pushed on to India and conquered the Punjaub, land of
      the five rivers.</p>
<p>
  8. Therefore the he-goat waxed very great:</p>
<p class="redcomment">Alexander the Great also conquered Egypt,
      Palestine, Phœnicia and Tyre. He built Alexandria and
      ruled from Greece to the Ganges.</p>
<p>and
  when he was strong, the great horn was broken;</p>
<p class="redcomment">Alexander died in India of intemperance and left
      no successor.</p>

<p>
  10. And it waxed great</p>
<p class="redcomment">under Antiochus&nbsp;<span

<p>even
  to the host of heaven;</p>

<p class="redcomment">Judah and Benjamin</p>
<p>and
  stamped upon them.</p>
<p>
  11. Yea it</p>
<p class="redcomment">under king Antiochus Epiphanes</p>
<p>magnified
  itself, even to the Prince of the host;</p>
<p class="redcomment">Judah, and the capital city Jerusalem</p>
<p>and
  it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place
  of his Sanctuary was cast down.</p>
<p class="redcomment">R.V.</p>
<p>
  12. And the host was given over to it together with the continual
  burnt offering through transgression;</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus also set up heathen altars in every
      village and town, on which the Jews were obliged to sacrifice
      swine’s flesh daily</p>
<p>and
  it cast down the truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and
  prospered.</p>
<p class="redcomment">R.V.</p>
<p>
  13. Then I heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto
  that certain saint which spake:—</p>
<p>
  “How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and
  the transgression of desolation, to give both the Sanctuary and
  the host</p>
<p class="redcomment">the National government</p>
<p>to
  be trodden under foot?”</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">62</span>

  14. And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
  days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p class="redcomment">The period amounted to 308&nbsp;yrs. 6&nbsp;mos.
      21&nbsp;days and extended from Oct.&nbsp;14th <span

<p>
  15. And it came to pass, when I,&nbsp;<em>even</em> I Daniel, had
  seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there
  stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p>
<p>
  16. And I heard a man’s voice between <em>the banks of</em>
  Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <em>man</em>
  to understand the vision.</p>
<p>
  17. So he came near where I&nbsp;stood: and when he came,
  I&nbsp;was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me,
  Understand, O&nbsp;son of man: for at the time of the end
  <em>shall be</em> the vision.</p>
<p>
  18. Now as he was speaking with me, I&nbsp;was in a deep sleep on
  my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me

  The next four verses should be read as a whole. The burden of
  their message is the date of Messiah’s sacrifice, the time when
  he would “be cut off, but not for himself.” An event of supreme
  moment to the entire human race. In making this revelation the
  heavenly visitor took the Sabbatic period of 7&nbsp;years as
  his standard of time. The Greeks had a system of Olympiads, each
  4&nbsp;years in length. In our day the standard measure is one
  year. We must therefore lay aside our ordinary line of thought
  and in reading the next 4&nbsp;verses we must accustom ourselves
  to thinking in <span
    class="allcap">PERIODS OF</span>
  7&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">YEARS EACH</span>
  and remember that whenever an event took place it happened in
  some period 7&nbsp;years in length. So that

  <span class="pagenum">69</span>

  when the angel spoke of “the going forth of the commandment” he
  pointed to a Sabbatic period of 7&nbsp; years, not to a certain
  day, hour, or minute of a given year, but to a group of
  7&nbsp;years as a whole, in a word to a certain “week,” when
  therefore, he spoke of more “weeks” to follow the additional
  ones came in regular succession and the sum of the series must
  of necessity equal the full time revealed. The starting point
  was plainly the river Ahava and the time of their Exodus from
  Persia was just 2&nbsp;days prior to the Passover of <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;458—see <span
      class="smcap">Note</span>&nbsp;E.
  The first “week” therefore ended in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;451,
  the second “week” in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;444,
  the third in&nbsp;437 and so on, until the end of the eighth week
  in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;402.
  Up to that time the Jews were favored by the Persian government,
  but Persia lost her power and influence at the battle of Cunaxa
  in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;401.
  Then followed 62&nbsp;Sabbatic periods, or 434&nbsp;years, ending
  with the Passover of <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;33
  at which time Messiah was cut off. The three periods, 1&nbsp;week
  plus 7&nbsp;weeks plus 62&nbsp;weeks make a total of
  “70&nbsp;weeks” and prove the accuracy of the heavenly
  prediction.</p>
<p>
  24. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy
  holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of
  sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring
  in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
  prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</p>
<p>
  25. Know therefore and understand, <em>that</em> from the</p>
<p class="redcomment">week of the</p>

<p class="redcomment">of Artaxerxes</p>

<p class="redcomment">How troublous is told by Nehemiah where he says:

      both the spears, the shields, and the bows and the coats of
      mail."</p>

  27. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:

  the oblation to cease,</p>
<p class="redcomment">This “one week” was divided into 2&nbsp;parts of
      3½&nbsp;years each. The first half covered the Ministry of the

  <span
    class="smcap">Remarks.</span>
  To understand what follows, all divisions of chapter and verse
  should be obliterated, from this point to the end of the book.
  The subject matter should be taken as descriptive of what Daniel
  saw and heard “by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel”
  “in the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia.” The description
  reminds us forcibly of the experiences of the apostle John and
  the apostle Paul. The vision had a twofold object: first, to
  reveal “what shall befall thy people in the latter days,” and
  second, to give additional information concerning Messiah’s
  kingdom said to be distant “many days.” The entire eleventh
  chapter from verse&nbsp;2 to the end is devoted to the days
  following Nehemiah’s rule. In the first four verses of
  Chapter&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XII.</span>
  we catch a glimpse of the coming kingdom, also the destruction
  of Jerusalem, while verses&nbsp;5 to&nbsp;13 set forth the
  coming of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="redcomment">
  More than 200&nbsp;years prior to Daniel’s day, the prophet Joel
  had pointed to the same great event

  <span class="pagenum">72</span>

  when he said:—“And it shall come to pass afterward, that
  I&nbsp;will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and
  your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams,
  your young men shall see visions; And also upon the servants and
  upon the handmaids in those days will I&nbsp;pour out my Spirit.”

  1. In the third year</p>
<p class="redcomment">third since the conquest of Babylon, but first in
      the personal reign over Babylon</p>
<p>of
  Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name
  was Belteshazzar; and the thing <em>was</em> true, but the time
  appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had
  understanding of the vision.</p>
<p>
  2. In those days I&nbsp;Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</p>
<p>
  3. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
  mouth, neither did I&nbsp;anoint myself at all, till three whole
  weeks were fulfilled.</p>
<p>
  4. And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as
  I&nbsp;was by the side of the great river, which <em>is</em>
  Hiddekel;</p>
<p class="redcomment">Tigris is the modern name for the river Hiddekel.

      March&nbsp;31st, <span

      and continued 3&nbsp;weeks until Saturday, April&nbsp;21st.
      Meantime the Passover occurred on Thursday, April&nbsp;12th.</p>
<p>
  5. Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain
  man clothed in linen, whose loins <em>were</em> girded with fine
  gold of Uphaz:</p>
<p class="redcomment">Ophir</p>
<p>
  6. His body also <em>was</em> like the beryl, and his face as the
  appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his
  arms and his feet like in colour to

  <span class="pagenum">74</span>

  polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a
  multitude.</p>
<p class="redcomment">“One like unto the Son of man, clothed with a
      garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a

      and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in

  that they fled to hide themselves.</p>

<p>
  9. Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I&nbsp;heard the
  voice of his words, then was I&nbsp;in a deep sleep on my face,
  and my face toward the ground.</p>

  Daniel was completely overcome by the glory of this Divine

  3. And a mighty king</p>
<p class="redcomment">Alexander the Great</p>
<p>shall
  stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according
  to his will.</p>
<p class="redcomment">from Greece to India.</p>

<p>they
  shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter</p>
<p class="redcomment">Bernice</p>
<p>of
  the south shall come to the king of the north to make an
  agreement:</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus banished his own wife Laodice and her

<p>but

<p>and

  7. But out of a branch of her roots</p>
<p class="redcomment">Ptolemy&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">II</span>,

  and shall deal against them and shall prevail:</p>
<p class="redcomment">Laodice placed her son Seleucus&nbsp;<span

        class="allcap">III</span>
      made an expedition against Syria, slew Laodice and conquered
      the realm from Cilicia to the Tigris.</p>

  8. And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
  their princes, <em>and</em> with their precious vessels of silver
  and of gold</p>
<p class="redcomment">the booty was immense, 2500&nbsp;idols,

<p>and
  he shall continue <em>more</em> years than the king of the

<p>

  <span class="pagenum">79</span>

  9. So the king of the south shall come into <em>his</em> kingdom,

  and <em>one</em> shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass

  to his fortress.</p>
<p>
  11. And the king of the south</p>
<p class="redcomment">Ptolemy&nbsp;<span

  13. For the king of the north</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus the Great</p>
<p>shall
  return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former,
  and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army

<p class="redcomment">secret enemies of the Jews</p>
<p>shall
  exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fail.</p>
<p>
  15. So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount,
  and take the most fenced cities; and the arms of the south shall
  not withstand, neither

  <span class="pagenum">80</span>

  his chosen people, neither <em>shall there be any</em> strength
  to withstand.</p>
<p>
  16. But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own

<p class="redcomment">the wars of Antiochus the Great</p>
<p>and
  none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious
  land</p>
<p class="redcomment">Palestine</p>
<p>which
  by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
<p>
  17. He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
  whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he
  shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her:</p>
<p class="redcomment">Using marriage for political gain: Antiochus gave
      his daughter Cleopatra in marriage to Ptolemy Epiphanes,
      hoping for benefit, but it turned out otherwise</p>
<p>but
  she shall not stand <em>on his side</em>, neither be for him.</p>
<p>
  18. After this he shall turn his face unto the Isles, and shall
  take many: but a prince</p>
<p class="redcomment">a Roman General</p>
<p>for
  his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease;
  without his own reproach</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus said:—“Asia did not concern the Romans

<p>he

<p>

<p class="redcomment">pillage the temples</p>
<p>but
  he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus the Great was slain.</p>
<p>
  20. Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes
  <em>in</em> the glory of the kingdom:</p>
<p class="redcomment">his son Seleucus Philopater, who sent out
      Heliodorus and taxed the

      <span class="pagenum">81</span>

<p>but
  within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor
  in battle.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Seleucus shortly after, died in a mysterious
      manner.</p>
<p>
  21. And in his estate shall stand up a vile person,</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus Epiphanes</p>
<p>to
  whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall
  come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
<p>
  22. And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
  before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
  covenant.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Onias&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">III</span>,
      the high priest was put to death by his order.</p>
<p>
  23. And after the league <em>made</em> with him he shall work

  a small people.</p>
<p>
  24. He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
  province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done,
  nor his father’s fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey,
  and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices
  against the strongholds even for a time.</p>
<p>
  25. And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
  of the south with a great army; and the king of the south</p>
<p class="redcomment">Ptolemy Philometer</p>
<p>shall
  be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he
  shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
<p>
  26. Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall
  destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall
  fall down slain.</p>
<p>

  <span class="pagenum">82</span>

  27. And both these kings’ hearts <em>shall</em> be to do
  mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table</p>
<p class="redcomment">a pretended friendship</p>
<p>but
  it shall not prosper: for yet the end <em>shall be</em> at
  the time appointed.</p>
<p>
  28. Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and
  his heart <em>shall be</em> against the holy covenant;</p>
<p class="redcomment">the worship of Jehovah</p>
<p>and
  he shall do <em>exploits</em>, and return to his own land.</p>
<p>
  29. At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
  south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
<p>
  30. For the ships of Chittim</p>
<p class="redcomment">the fleet of the Romans under Laenas</p>
<p>shall
  come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and
  have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he
  shall even return, and have intelligence with them</p>
<p class="redcomment">the Samaritans</p>
<p>that
  forsake the holy covenant.</p>
<p>
  31. And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
  sanctuary of strength,</p>
<p class="redcomment">the Temple</p>
<p>and
  shall take away the daily <em>sacrifice</em>, and they shall
  place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus Epiphanes established idol-altars in
      every town and village of Palestine, and ordered a daily
      sacrifice of swine on the altars.</p>
<p>
  32. And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
  by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be
  strong and do <em>exploits</em>.</p>
<p class="redcomment">Mattathias and his 5&nbsp;sons, the

  shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by
  flame, by captivity, and by spoil, <em>many</em> days.</p>
<p>
  34. Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
  help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
<p class="redcomment">see life of Judas Maccabeus.</p>
<p>
  35. And <em>some</em> of them of understanding shall fall,
  to try them, and to purge, and to make <em>them</em> white,
  <em>even</em> to the time of the end: because <em>it is</em>
  yet for a time appointed.</p>
<p>
  36. And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall
  exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
  speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
  prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that, that
  is determined shall be done.</p>
<p>
  37. Neither shall he regard the god of his fathers, nor the
  desire of women,</p>
<p class="redcomment">in other words, the idol Astarte, “the queen of
      heaven”</p>
<p>nor
  regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
<p>
  38. But in his estate shall he honor the God of forces:</p>
<p class="redcomment">a god of castles or fortresses</p>
<p>and
  a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold,
  and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
<p>
  39. Thus shall he do in the most strongholds with a strange
  god, whom he shall acknowledge <em>and</em> increase with glory:
  and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the
  land for gain.</p>
<p>
  40. And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push
  at him: and the king of the north

  <span class="pagenum">84</span>

  shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and
  with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into
  the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
<p>
  41. He shall enter also into the glorious land,</p>
<p class="redcomment">Palestine</p>
<p>and
  many <em>countries</em> shall be overthrown: but these shall
  escape out of his hand, <em>even</em> Edom, and Moab, and the
  chief of the children of Ammon</p>
<p class="redcomment">Antiochus passed them by. When, however, they
      tried to take advantage of <span

  the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
<p>
  43. But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
  silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
  Libyans and the Ethiopians <em>shall</em> be at his steps.</p>
<p>
  44. But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall

<p>stand
  up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy

      many bodies of the saints which slept arose. And came out of

<p>

<p class="redcomment">In verses&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5 of chapter&nbsp;<span

  7. And I heard the man clothed in linen, which <em>was</em> upon

  <em>it shall be</em> for a time, times, and an half; and when he

  <em>things</em>?</p>
<p>
  9. And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <em>are</em>

<p>
  10. Many shall be purified, and made white,</p>
<p class="redcomment">“And the same day there were added <em>unto

        class="allcap">II.</span>&nbsp;41.—“Howbeit

  the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall

  We pause at the beginning of the 171st year because it was a
  year of great moment in the life of the Jewish nation. The
  deepest interest is focussed on “the 23rd day of the 2nd month”
  when Simon, brother of Judas Maccabeus, “destroyed a great
  enemy out of Israel,” and <span
    class="allcap">CLEANSED</span>
  the Temple of

  <span class="pagenum">92</span>

  its abominations. He also ordained, that the day should be observed
  ever after, as a National holiday.—<span
    class="allcap">I</span>&nbsp;Macc.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XIII.</span>&nbsp;51.</p>
<p>
  We note that the 171st year, like all others of the Seleucidæ,
  began with the month of October, which was the first month of
  the Macedonian calendar. It was called Hyperberetaeus, the
  second month Dius, the third, Apellaeus and so on. But the
  question that concerns us most is, whether the writer of First
  Maccabees actually reckoned by Macedonian months? A careful
  examination of the entire book shows that he mentioned
  4&nbsp;Hebrew months by name—“Casleu, Adar, Elul and Sabat”—also
  that he clearly located another, viz:—Tisri, but not in a single
  instance did he mention the name of a Macedonian month, or refer
  to the Macedonian calendar in any manner whatsoever. That he did
  not regard October as being the <span
    class="allcap">FIRST</span>
  month is plainly declared in <span
    class="allcap">I</span>&nbsp;Macc.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">X.</span>&nbsp;21,
  where he says:—</p>
<p class="blk10 i0">
  “So in the <span
    class="allcap">SEVENTH</span>
  month of the 160th year, at the feast of tabernacles, Jonathan
  put on the holy robe,” etc.</p>
<p>
  Sept./Oct. therefore was the <span
    class="allcap">SEVENTH</span>
  month, according to the usage of the writer of the First book of
  Maccabees, which gives the following succession:—</p>

  The rest of the way is easy. We have only to follow the Jewish
  calendar of Rabbi Hillel&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">II</span>
  and we learn that the “23rd day of the <span
    class="allcap">SECOND</span>
  month” corresponded with the</p>
<p class="blk10">
  4<span
    class="smcap">th day of May</span> <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141,</p>
<p class="i0">
  the great day of National Independence. Having thus far followed
  exclusively the years of the Seleucidæ as common among Greeks
  and Orientals, let us now turn to the system of the Babylonians.
  Their era began, as already explained, with the spring of <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;311.
  Accordingly, their 171st year began with the spring of <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141,
  and the <span
    class="allcap">SECOND</span>
  month of course coincided with Apr./May, or the Jewish month
  Iyar. It matters not, therefore, whether you follow the system
  of the Greeks or that of the Babylonians, you will arrive at
  the same goal, viz:—May&nbsp;4th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141.</p>
<p>
  One can hardly overestimate the importance of this discovery,
  because a knowledge of the National Independence day gives a
  fixed starting point for that mysterious group of <span
    class="allcap">DAYS</span>—2300,
  1290 and 1335—as revealed by the angel Gabriel to “Daniel the
  Prophet.”</p>

  NOTE A.<br /><span
    class="sm">
      DARIUS, OR CYAXARES. [DANIEL <span
        class="allcap">V.</span>&nbsp;31.]</span></h2>
<p>
  “And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
  and two years old.” In the first verse of the 9th chapter we are
  told that Darius was the son of Ahasuerus, the same Assuerus
  spoken of in the 15th verse of the 14th chapter of Tobit, the
  Astyages of Median history. Astyages was king of the Medes and
  reigned for 35&nbsp;years from <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;593-558.
  His son Cyaxares [Josephus&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">X.</span>&nbsp;11,&nbsp;4.]
  succeeded him on the throne and his daughter Mandané married
  Cambyses of Persia. Their offspring was Cyrus the Great, who
  thus represented the Royal houses of both Media and Persia.
  Cyaxares therefore was the uncle of Cyrus. As a boy Cyrus was
  brought up by his grandfather and accompanied his uncle on
  shooting expeditions. A very strong attachment was formed
  with the latter so that in after years when Cyrus deposed his
  grandfather, in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;558,
  he made his uncle the king of Media. Still later when Cyrus took
  Babylon and pacified the inhabitants he made his uncle Cyaxares
  king <em
    lang="lat"
    xml:lang="lat">pro tem</em>,
  who occupied the throne from <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;538-536.
  Cyrus of course continued to be, as the annalistic tablet
  relates, “the powerful king, the king of Babylon, ‘the king
  of Sumar and Akkad’—the king of the four zones.” But the laws
  of Persia as outlined

  <span class="pagenum">96</span>

  by Herodotus&nbsp;[<span
    class="allcap">VII.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;2.
  and <span
    class="allcap">III.</span>&nbsp;66]
  made it necessary for him to appoint a successor before starting
  out to war, who would govern during his absence. So we find,
  “after Gobryas the governor of the country of Ararat and the
  soldiers of Cyrus, without fighting entered Babylon,” the country
  became submissive and attention could be directed elsewhere; that
  “when in the course of their march they arrived in the Median
  territory Cyrus turned off to visit Cyaxares; and after they had
  embraced each other, Cyrus first told Cyaxares that there were
  domestics and palaces set apart for him in Babylon, that when
  he came thither he might have what was his own to come to.”
  [Xenophon&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">VIII.</span>]
  It is hard to imagine how Cyrus could have paved the way more
  perfectly for the reign of his uncle Cyaxares in Babylon, whom
  we believe was Darius the Mede of Scripture. His reign was of
  short duration, but it came at a critical period in the history
  of the Jews. Only two years remained to complete the <span
    title="TN: originally spelled ‘Babylonion’"
    class="msg">Babylonian</span>
  captivity and Divine influences were at work for the return of
  the chosen people. [Daniel&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">X.</span>&nbsp;13.]
  More than a century previous to that time the Scriptures had
  named Cyrus as the “shepherd,” [Isaiah&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XLV.</span>&nbsp;1,&nbsp;3.]
  and when Cyrus placed his uncle temporarily on the throne of
  Babylon, a heavenly messenger was sent to Darius who “stood to
  confirm and strengthen him.” [Daniel&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XI.</span>&nbsp;1.]
  This gave the Jews a friend at court who paved the way for that
  celebrated emancipation proclamation which Cyrus issued on his

  <span class="pagenum">97</span>

  return to Babylon. Naturally such a document belonged among the
  state papers and should have been found “in the house of the
  rolls where the treasures were laid up in Babylon,” but diligent
  search proved of no avail. [Ezra&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">VI.</span>&nbsp;1.]
  However, as the document was dated in the time of Darius the
  Mede, official attention was next directed to “the palace that
  is in the province of the Medes,” where a careful search proved
  successful. [Ezra&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">VI.</span>&nbsp;2.]
  There they found the original “roll” stowed away among the royal
  documents and forwarded it to King Darius Hystaspes. The king
  promptly ratified the decree of Cyrus and added, “Let it be done
  with speed.” The history of Darius the Mede is therefore one of
  peculiar interest in the life of the Jewish people.</p>

  NOTE B.<br /><span
    class="sm">“THE SUM OF THE MATTERS.” [DANIEL&nbsp;<span
      class="allcap">VII.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;AND&nbsp;25.]</span>
  </h2>
<p>
  The vision of the four great beasts is now complete and we
  have reached the sum of the matters in verse&nbsp;25. Already
  in chapter&nbsp;II. the same subject was summarized by the
  following language: “In the days of these kings shall the God
  of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed ...
  and it shall stand forever.” The present summary differs from
  the first in that it localizes the endless kingdom, and tells
  the year when it would be set up. Whenever we send a telegram
  and wish to conceal our meaning from the public we employ single
  words to express conditions and quantities. Twice, Daniel was
  told by his heavenly visitor:—“shut thou up the vision,” it is
  therefore proper to infer that the word <span
    class="allcap">TIME</span>
  was used to express a certain number of years and <span
    class="allcap">TIMES</span>
  to express a greater number of years. But what heavenly measure
  of time do we find in the Bible, associated with the punishment
  of nations, that can be taken as the unit period for measuring
  seasons of God’s displeasure? Turn to Zech.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;12th
  and we read:—“Then the angel of the Lord answered and said,
  O&nbsp;Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on
  Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah against which thou hast had
  indignation these threescore

  <span class="pagenum">100</span>

  and ten years.” For other examples, see <span
    class="smcap">Note&nbsp;D.</span>
  If then the word <span
    class="allcap">TIME</span>
  was inserted in the heavenly message as a symbol for 70&nbsp;years,
  and the numeral&nbsp;7 conveyed to the Jewish mind the idea of a
  perfect quantity, then a week of <span
    class="allcap">TIME</span>,
  or 7&nbsp;times&nbsp;70 might very naturally be symbolized by the
  word <span
    class="allcap">TIMES</span>.
  We find in Gen.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">II.</span>&nbsp;4.
  that the 7&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">DAYS</span>
  of creation are spoken of in the singular as, “the <span
    class="allcap">DAY</span>
  the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.” Besides every 7th
  year was a Sabbatic year. So that whatever the word <span
    class="allcap">TIME</span>
  means in the singular, we may reasonably take the word <span
    class="allcap">TIMES</span>
  to mean a 7&nbsp;fold quantity in the plural. We find another
  measure in Matt.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XVIII.</span>&nbsp;22.
  where the Divine idea of forgiveness is expressed in numerals.
  The apostle Peter thought that he did well in fixing the unit
  of forgiveness at 7&nbsp;fold, but he was told to multiply his
  scant number by&nbsp;70 before he could attain to the Divine
  standard. If now we substitute these values for their symbols
  in the formula: “Time, Times and Half-time” we shall obtain,
  70&nbsp;plus&nbsp;490, plus&nbsp;35, equals to 595&nbsp;years.
  Verse four supplies the initial date for this series of years.
  From it we learn that the “sum of the matters” started with the
  Medo-Persian kingdom of Cyrus, who united in his own person the
  blood of both royal houses and became king in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;558.
  From this date to the Christian era was 557&nbsp;years and from
  the era to <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;39
  was 38&nbsp;years more, making a total of&nbsp;557 plus&nbsp;38,
  or 595&nbsp;years. From which we learn that the “sum of

  <span class="pagenum">101</span>

  the matters” or the full time arrived for the setting up of the
  kingdom in <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;39.
  The prophecy therefore gives us the year, and we shall find that
  the 12th verse of the 12th chapter supplies the day when “all
  these things” were finished. The apostle Peter in describing the
  events of that day said:—“Forasmuch then as God gave them (the
  Gentiles) the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the
  Lord Jesus Christ, what was&nbsp;I, that I&nbsp;could withstand
  God? When they heard these things they held their peace, and
  glorified God, saying, Then hath God also on the Gentiles granted
  repentance unto life.” Acts&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XI.</span>&nbsp;17,&nbsp;18.</p>
<p>
  The admission of the Gentiles was deemed a matter of so great
  importance that the formula has been repeated in the 7th verse
  of the 12th chapter, also material has been given in the 12th
  verse of the same chapter by which the very day itself can be
  computed. The passages stand to each other in the relation of
  demonstration to proof.</p>

<div id="note_C">
  <span class="pagenum">103</span></div>
<h2 class="v8">
  NOTE C.<br /><span
    class="sm">“DAYS.”</span></h2>
<p>
  In searching for symbolic numbers we found that number&nbsp;49
  stood both for the Jubilee year and for the Feast of
  Weeks:—Concerning the Jubilee it was said:—“And thou shalt
  number 7&nbsp;sabbaths of years unto thee, 7&nbsp;times
  7&nbsp;years: and the space of 7&nbsp;sabbaths of years shall
  be unto thee 49&nbsp;years.” Leviticus&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XXV.</span>&nbsp;8.—Concerning
  Pentecost it was said: “And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks
  unto the Lord thy God”—“Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee:
  begin to number the 7&nbsp;weeks from such time as thou beginnest
  to put the sickle to the corn.” Deu.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XVI.</span>&nbsp;9,&nbsp;10.
  The feast was to be kept in a fourfold manner with the offering
  of a tribute, with rejoicing, with remembrance, and with
  obedience. For more than 3600&nbsp;years has this beautiful
  custom been observed among the Jews, so that&nbsp;49, the number
  of days, comes to us with special emphasis. With such a prominent
  place assigned to it in the Jewish ritual, no wonder if it found
  a place in the symbolic language of the heavenly visitor. We
  have discovered that such was the case and accordingly have
  made calculations for the three periods represented by
  “2300&nbsp;days,” “1290&nbsp;days” and “45&nbsp;days” (1335
  less 1290) on the basis that each prophetic “day” equals
  49&nbsp;ordinary days of 24&nbsp;hours each.

  <span class="pagenum">104</span>

  They stand for 112,700 ordinary days; 63,210&nbsp;days and
  2205&nbsp;days. In reducing these days to years the sidereal year
  was taken as the Standard year. A sidereal year, or time in which
  the earth makes one revolution, the point of reference being a
  fixed star, amounts to 365&nbsp;days 6&nbsp;hours 9&nbsp;minutes
  9<sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;seconds, expressed decimally
  it equals 365.2563611 days. By dividing each period of ordinary
  days by the number of days in a sidereal year we obtain the
  actual length of each prophetic period. In arranging these
  periods, the starting point was May&nbsp;4th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141,
  or day on which the Temple precincts were cleansed by
  Simon Maccabeus. The 1290&nbsp;days carries us directly to
  May&nbsp;24th <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;33,
  which was the day of Pentecost “that great and notable day of
  the Lord” when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples at
  Jerusalem. It is interesting to note in this case how very
  precise is the language of Scripture. The passage reads:—“When
  the day of Pentecost was <span
    class="allcap">FULLY</span>
  come.” After their
  return from Babylon the Jews were accustomed to devote two days,
  instead of one, to the observance of the feast, and as Pentecost
  that year fell on May&nbsp;23rd and&nbsp;24th, the day of
  Pentecost was <span
    class="allcap">FULLY</span>
  come on the day indicated by our chart. The event therefore
  happened precisely as foretold by the heavenly visitor, who
  said to Daniel, “the vision of the evening and the morning
  which was told is <span
    class="allcap">TRUE</span>,”
  and it came about with that degree of exactness with which
  astronomers become familiar in their study

  <span class="pagenum">105</span>

  of the heavenly bodies. The chart clearly proves that the
  “1290&nbsp;days” is a perfect fit between two well-known
  dates. The other periods give us two extremely important
  dates heretofore absolutely unknown to Bible students.</p>

  The Holy Spirit’s appearance to the Gentiles in the Summer
  of <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;39
  was at a time peculiarly favorable for the conversion of
  Cornelius. The persecution of <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;36,
  following the dismissal of Pilate, was succeeded by a period of
  rest and rapid growth among the infant churches. There was, then,
  neither the marching of armies, nor even the rumor of war. True,
  these all came in the Fall of <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;40,
  when Petronius was sent to Syria with instructions to place the
  images of the Romans in the Temple at Jerusalem. It may be said
  in passing, that the expedition landed in Ptolemais and there
  wintered. But in the Spring of <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;41
  the attitude of the Jews was so determined, that Petronius sent
  to Rome for additional instructions. The Emperor, however, died
  quite suddenly, and the expedition was finally abandoned. The
  year <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;39
  was a time of peace and good order; a time most favorable to the
  all-important mission of the Holy Spirit.</p>

  NOTE D.<br /><span
    class="sm">“TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED DAYS.”
      [DANIEL&nbsp;<span
        class="allcap">VIII.</span>&nbsp;14.]</span></h2>
<p>
  In the vision of “the evening and the morning” it is evident
  that 2300&nbsp;days must end with a complete cleansing of the
  sanctuary, and unquestionably this was accomplished by Simon
  Maccabeus on May the 4th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141. [<span
    class="allcap">I</span>&nbsp;Mac.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XIII.</span>&nbsp;51];
  but at what time they should begin to count is not so evident.
  The 19th verse tells us: “I&nbsp;will make thee know what shall be
  in the last end of the indignation.”</p>
<p>
  We ask: what indignation? When was the first end? When the
  middle? and When the last end?</p>
<p>
  We note first, that the speaker was the angel Gabriel,
  consequently the indignation referred to was of Divine
  origin. The word indignation stands for “sore displeasure”
  [Zech&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;2].
  It arose in the year <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;590,
  the seventh of the captivity, at which time Israel was cast off
  and Nebuchadnezzar prepared to wage war against them. It was
  announced in the following words:—“As I&nbsp;live saith the Lord
  God, I&nbsp;will not be inquired of by you” [Ezek.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XX.</span>&nbsp;3].
  The indignation lasted just 70&nbsp;years [Zech.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;12]
  and ended by a promise of pardon made in the eighth month, which
  according to the calendar of Rabbi Hillel&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">II.</span>
  (<span
    class="smcap">Idan Olamim</span>
  of J.&nbsp;L. Sossnitz) began October&nbsp;25th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;520
  [Zech.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;1
  and&nbsp;3]. We

  <span class="pagenum">108</span>

  note in passing that although Cyrus put an end to the Babylonian
  captivity in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;536
  and the people returned to the land of Judea, yet they encountered
  insuperable obstacles which held up their work [Ezra&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">V.</span>&nbsp;3]
  until the year <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;520,
  which was the end of 70&nbsp;years’ indignation. From these
  passages we learn what were the limitations in one case of
  “sore displeasure.” But Isaiah prophesied that Jerusalem would
  receive of the Lord’s hand <em>double</em> for all her sins
  [Isa.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XL.</span>&nbsp;2].
  Jeremiah also spoke in the same vein “And first I&nbsp;will
  recompense their iniquity and their sin <em>double</em>”
  [Jer.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XVI.</span>&nbsp;18].
  When we reach <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;433
  we find that Nehemiah dreaded a still further return of God’s
  sore displeasure and warned the nobles of Judah against profaning
  the Sabbath day. [Neh.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XIII.</span>&nbsp;16,&nbsp;18.]
  As the first indignation ended with the 8th month of <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;520,
  a double period ought to end with the 8th month of <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;450,
  that is, with October&nbsp;2nd of that year. But you object, how
  could a period be truly 70&nbsp;years in length, when it began with
  October&nbsp;25th and ended with October the 2nd? This question
  admits of easy explanation. According to the Jewish calendar the
  eighth month comes and goes with the phases of the moon, just like
  our Easter occurs at different seasons, hence we must take the
  average of these dates, viz: October the 14th as our representative
  day. We have already alluded to the delays experienced by the Jews
  when freed by Cyrus and desire at this point to draw attention to
  the fact that

  <span class="pagenum">109</span>

  Zerubbabel’s temple was not completed until <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;515, <span
    class="allcap">JUST</span> 5&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">YEARS</span>
  after the indignation period expired, in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;520;
  and that in like manner Nehemiah’s temple was not completed
  until <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;445, <span
    class="allcap">JUST</span> 5&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">YEARS</span>
  after the next indignation period expired, in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;450.
  We might also add that from the time when the Jews first
  worshipped in Babylon as captives in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;585,
  to the time when they worshipped in Zerubbabel’s temple as free
  men in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;515
  was another instance of a period 70&nbsp;years long. This
  frequent recurrence of 70-year periods shows that as a
  numeral&nbsp;70 may justly be regarded as one of the units
  of <span
    class="allcap">TIME</span>
  in the dispensation of God’s providence, and therefore to be
  reckoned with in the study of prophecy.</p>
<p>
  But returning to our representative day, October&nbsp;14th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;450,
  we realize that when the first and the second indignation had
  passed, the time came for “the last end of the indignation”
  spoken of in the 19th verse, and known as the “2300&nbsp;days.”
  By the calculations given in <span
    class="smcap">Note&nbsp;C</span>,
  we find that 2300 prophetic days exactly fill the interval
  between Oct.&nbsp;14th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;450
  and May the 4th <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141.
  Having thus brought out the limitations of the “2300&nbsp;days”
  we would add, that Daniel’s eleventh chapter gives in outline
  a complete history of the period under consideration, so that
  the Jews had it in their power to tell the prophetic time of day
  at any moment between <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;450
  and <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;141.</p>

    class="sm">THE EXODUS FROM PERSIA. [DANIEL&nbsp;<span
      class="allcap">IX.</span>&nbsp;25.]</span></h2>
<p>
  Ezra gives a full account of this great event in his history of
  the Jews, in the <span
    class="allcap">VIII</span>th
  and <span
    class="allcap">VII</span>th
  chapters of his book, where he says, they “began to go from
  Babylon” on the 1st&nbsp;day of the 1st&nbsp;month in the
  7th&nbsp;year of king Artaxerxes, also that they were not fairly
  under way until the 12th&nbsp;day of the 1st&nbsp;month, which was
  within two days of the Passover. After a journey of 4&nbsp;months
  they arrived at the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
  In fixing the date of the Exodus from Persia we must determine
  the boundaries of the 7th&nbsp;year of Artaxerxes. First, as to the
  year itself, it has been well established that his reign began
  in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;465.
  Then as to the month, the statement found in Neh.&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;1.
  and <span
    class="allcap">II.</span>&nbsp;1.
  render a commencement impossible between the months of November
  and March, while the statement made in Ezra&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">VII.</span>&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8
  and&nbsp;9 preclude the interval from March to August following.
  This narrows the field for the commencement of Artaxerxes’
  reign down to the months of August, September and October.
  Although there is no possible way of distinguishing between
  the relative claims of these three months, yet from the wording
  of Nehemiah&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">I.</span>&nbsp;1.
  we shall decide in favor of the last, viz: the month of
  October.</p>

  NOTE F.<br /><span
    class="sm">DATE OF THE CRUCIFIXION. [DANIEL&nbsp;<span
      class="allcap">IX.</span>&nbsp;26.]</span></h2>
<p>
  Since the prophecy of Daniel points directly to the time when
  Messiah would be cut off and not to the date of Christ’s birth,
  it is evident that neither the natal day nor the length of his
  life on earth are necessary to a complete understanding of the
  prophecy. What we need most to know are the day and the year
  in which Messiah was crucified. Happily these points can be
  determined by data found in the Bible. Turn to Luke&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">III.</span>&nbsp;1
  and&nbsp;23 and we learn that Jesus “began to be about
  30&nbsp;years of age” in the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar.
  Not that Jesus attained the age of&nbsp;30 in the 15th year
  of Tiberius, but that when the last day of the 15th year arrived,
  viz: Aug.&nbsp;18th <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;29,
  Jesus was <span
    class="allcap">VERY NEAR</span>
  30&nbsp;years old. His birthday anniversary therefore comes in
  the Fall of the year. From that time on, we count 3½&nbsp;years
  to his crucifixion in <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;33.
  We learn from the parable of the barren fig tree, also from
  Daniel’s prophecy that Messiah’s ministry would last one-half
  a prophetic week, or 3½&nbsp;years. The parable itself accounts
  for 3&nbsp;years: “Behold these three years I&nbsp;come seeking
  fruit and find none;” and since the parable was given, about the
  time of the harvest home, or feast of tabernacles, another half
  year was necessary to carry the time over from

  <span class="pagenum">116</span>

  the feast of tabernacles to the following Passover. When this
  was completed his ministry ended. At the very outset of our
  Lord’s ministry he spoke of the work before him and proclaimed
  God’s good pleasure in sending him, to preach the gospel to the
  poor, to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the
  captives, the recovery of sight to the blind, and to set at
  liberty them that are bruised. [Luke&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">IV</span>.&nbsp;18.]
  With this ministry expressive of God’s favor, He then contrasted
  the ministry of Elias, expressive of God’s displeasure “when the
  heaven was shut up 3&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">YEARS AND SIX MONTHS</span>,
  when great famine was throughout the land.” This reference seems
  to have been a sign as to the exact length of time Christ’s
  ministry would continue on earth, precisely as the experience
  of Jonah in the fish was a sign of the length of time Christ
  would remain “in the heart of the earth.” [Matthew&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">XII.</span>&nbsp;40.]
  But the strongest evidence is furnished by the 4&nbsp;Passovers
  which were celebrated during the period of said ministry.</p>

  As regards the exact date of the fourth Passover we know by
  astronomy that there was a full moon

  <span class="pagenum">117</span>

  at 4.15&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">P.M.</span>
  on Friday April&nbsp;3 <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;33.
  On that day therefore Messiah was “cut off.”</p>
<p>
  At this point let us glance backward 490&nbsp;years, or
  70&nbsp;weeks to the Passover of <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;458,
  and we shall meet the children of Israel making their Exodus from
  Persia [Ezra&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">VIII.</span>&nbsp;31]
  “going forth” under the leadership of Ezra, by “commandment” of
  Artaxerxes ordering them “to restore and to build Jerusalem.” In
  view of this marvellous fulfilment of prophecy, how frivolous do
  seem the charges of those who claim that the Book of Daniel is—“a
  bundle of loose leaves”—“a consolatory political pamphlet”—and
  “written as historic fiction in 168-165&nbsp;<span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>”
  Pretty good fiction, is it not? for one writing in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;168
  to make declaration that a certain event, figured from a given
  starting point, would <em>positively</em> take place at the end
  of 490&nbsp;years! We have many writers of historic fiction
  in our own day, but none so venturesome as “the chief of the
  governors over all the wise men of Babylon.” Those who call the
  predictions found in the Book of Daniel—“historic fiction”—simply
  destroy the meaning of words and pour contempt upon the Word of
  God.</p>
<p>
  Our explanation robs the <span
    class="allcap">IX</span>th

  CHRONOLOGY.</p>
<h2 class="v4">
  THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.</h2>
<p>
  Christ was born in the year <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;2.
  In support of this announcement we do not propose to give a table
  of dates, setting forth the ideas of the Christian Fathers who
  wrote prior to the 5th century. Nor those of Dionysius Exiguus,
  of the Venerable Bede, or of Roger Bacon, all of whom wrote
  between the 5th and the 14th centuries. Neither shall we give
  those of Archbishops Usher and Lloyd in the 17th century, nor
  those of Dr. Hales and of Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century,
  nor those of Prideaux and of the talented chronologist
  H.&nbsp;Fynes Clinton in the 19th century. We find our authority
  in Eusebius the “father of ecclesiastical history” [<span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;325]
  and give with it a 20th century Chart in proof of the accuracy
  of his statement.</p>
<p>
  Of course back of Eusebius lay Jewish tradition, which in modern
  times has found expression in the “Jewish Calendar” of E.&nbsp;H.
  Lindo; London,&nbsp;1838. Under the title of the “Book of the
  Generations,” that noted chronologist states that the Christian
  Era began with the year <span
    class="allcap">A.M.</span>&nbsp;3760,
  in other words with the 30th day of August <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;2
  as shown in the diagram.</p>

    LOCATION OF CHRISTIAN ERA</p>
</div>
<p class="v1">

  <span class="pagenum">123</span>

  Eusebius, who as Bishop of Caesarea, spent most of his life
  in Judea, possessed rare opportunities for verifying Jewish
  tradition. It is very significant that his scholarly research
  led him to accept and endorse a date for the commencement
  of the Christian Era, which is identically the same as that
  preserved by the Jews.</p>
<p>
  The New Testament plainly declares that Christ was born shortly
  prior to the death of Herod the Great. The most perfect history
  we possess of Herod’s life is found in the works of Flavius
  Josephus, who acknowledged indebtedness to the “Commentaries
  of King Herod,” and to the works of “Nicolaus of Damascus, the
  historiographer of Herod.” It should be remembered that for his
  facts Josephus depended entirely on others, because Herod died
  almost 40&nbsp;years before Josephus was born and therefore,
  however accurate Josephus might be individually, he was liable to
  be mistaken by the error of others. Let us turn to the <span
    class="allcap">XIV</span>th
  book of his “Antiquities,” because it contains a statement of
  more than ordinary precision which bears directly on the date
  of Herod’s death and may rightly be regarded as the corner stone
  of Josephus’ calculations regarding Herod’s reign. It is there
  recorded that Hyrcanus began to rule in the “3d year of the 177th
  olympiad” [<span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;<sup>70</sup>/<sub>69</sub>].
  At first sight, one cannot help being pleased, that in so
  important a matter, Josephus took special pains to be exact,
  for nowhere else in all his writings does he

  <span class="pagenum">124</span>

  give the year of any olympiad. It was his custom simply to
  announce the olympiad and leave the reader to guess in which
  one of four years the event took place. However, in this one
  instance he gave the year and left nothing to be supplied. This
  apparent accuracy has led many readers astray, for they have
  lost sight of the fact that his statement is not historically
  correct.</p>
<p>
  It is a well-established fact that Pompey took Jerusalem on the
  24th day of May, <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;63,
  that he deposed Aristobulus and made Hyrcanus monarch. According
  to this, the brothers reigned about 6¾&nbsp;years. Josephus,
  however, states that one reigned 3&nbsp;years and 6&nbsp;months
  [<span
    class="allcap">XIV.</span>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;1],
  and the other reigned only 3&nbsp;months [<span
    class="allcap">XV.</span>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;4],
  making a total of 3¾&nbsp;years instead of 6¾&nbsp;years. Here,
  then, we have discovered a huge gap of about 3&nbsp;years in the
  reckoning of Josephus. We believe this is the first time that
  public attention has been directed to this grave error: we say
  grave, because it has led the Christian world astray and fostered
  the belief that Christ was born in <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;5
  instead of the year <span
    class="allcap">B.C.</span>&nbsp;2.
  Happily, Eusebius escaped this pitfall.</p>
<p>
  It is evident from the chart, that in the case of 6&nbsp;reigns
  Josephus <span
    class="allcap">STRETCHED HIS FIGURES</span>
  and made them occupy 103&nbsp;years instead of 100&nbsp;years.
  This proves that his figures, in part, were matters of
  calculation and not rigid statements of historical facts.
  No notice can be taken of the joint-rule exercised by Augustus
  and Tiberius between

  <span class="pagenum">125</span>

  <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;11
  and&nbsp;14, because that mode of reckoning is unnatural. The day
  of one’s death is the natural dividing line between reigns, and
  as Augustus Caesar died on the 19th day of August, <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;14
  Tiberius Caesar began to reign on the same day. Besides, to
  admit a joint-rule would hopelessly add another 3&nbsp;years to
  Josephus’ error and put him in the light of having carried his
  process for <span
    class="allcap">STRETCHING FIGURES</span>
  6&nbsp;points instead of 3&nbsp;points. What he did do in that
  line is bad enough, without making matters worse.</p>
<p>
  It will be observed that the work of contracting Josephus’
  figures has been accomplished in part on the second line, but
  the final rectification appears on the last line. These results
  maintain the integrity of all that Josephus said about the
  following olympiads, viz: the 179th, 184th, 185th, 187th, and
  192nd.—They also accord with the discovery of Zumpt regarding
  a double term in the governorship of Cyrenius. We reach a solid
  ground on the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar and arrive at last at
  the first Easter Sunday, viz: April&nbsp;5, <span
    class="allcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;33,
  the end of the <span
    class="allcap">SEVENTY WEEKS</span>
  of the Prophet Daniel.</p>
<p>
  In conclusion we observe, that the life of Christ on earth
  covered a period of 33½&nbsp;years, and that</p>

  This government was founded by a priest named Mattathias, who
  had five sons named respectively:—John, Simon, Judas, Eleazar,
  and Jonathan. The dynasty lasted 130&nbsp;years and was
  succeeded by the Idumean dynasty of Herod the Great. The
  dates here given result from a geometric plotting of the
  facts given by Josephus and the books of the Maccabees.</p>
